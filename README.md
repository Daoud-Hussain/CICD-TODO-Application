## CI/CD Pipeline for a Full Stack Application Using SonarQube, OWASP Dependency Check, and Trivy

In this CI/CD pipeline, we integrate robust tools to ensure code quality, security, and compliance for our full stack application. The pipeline comprises the following components:

 - **SonarQube**: For continuous code quality inspection, detecting bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in the application code.
 - **OWASP Dependency Check**: To identify and report known vulnerabilities in project dependencies, ensuring third-party libraries are secure.
 - **Trivy**: A comprehensive security scanner for containers, identifying vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other potential security risks in Docker images.

This pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring that only secure and high-quality code reaches production.
